# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML
The goal is to create a classifier that can predict client attrition.

There are 10,000 samples in this dataset, which was obtained from Kaggle.

The proper visualisation has been carried out by closely examining the properties.

'exited' is the desired variable in this case.

Used K-nearest neighbours, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine methods.
