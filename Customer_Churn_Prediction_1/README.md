## Customer Churn Prediction



## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition
The 'Customer Churn table' provides data on each of the '7,043' customers of a 'Telecommunications firm' in California in Q2 2022.

One "client" is represented by each record, which includes information on their "demographics," "location," "tenure," "subscription services," "status for the quarter," (joined, stayed, or churned)," and more!

In addition to the data in the Customer Churn table, the 'Zip Code Population' table provides estimates of the populations for the zip codes in California.

Based on the dataset's parameters, we need to "predict" if a client would "churn," "stay," or "join" the business.
