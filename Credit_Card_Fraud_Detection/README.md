# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Model for detecting fraud with anonymised credit card transactions

In order to prevent customers from being charged for products they did not buy, credit card firms must be able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

The files include credit card transactions done by European cardholders in September 2013.
We have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions in our dataset of transactions that took place over the course of two days. The dataset is quite skewed, with frauds making up 0.172% of all transactions in the positive class.
